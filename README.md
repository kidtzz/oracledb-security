# Oracle Database Security

Welcome to the **Oracle Database Security Workshop** 

As part of this workshop, you will complete labs helping you to better understand:

- [Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT)](Lab_Guides%2FDBSAT%2FREADME.md)
- [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](Lab_Guides/ASO/README.md)
- [Key Vault (OKV)](Lab_Guides/OKV/README.md)
- [Data Redaction](Lab_Guides/Redaction/README.md)

- [Database Vault (DV)](Lab_Guides/DV/README.md)
- [Privilege Analysis (PA)](Lab_Guides/PA/README.md)
- [Audit Vault & Database Firewall (AVDF)](Lab_Guides/AVDF/README.md)
- [Data Masking (DMS)](Lab_Guides/DMS/README.md)

Each lab is independent and as such you can complete them in any order you choose. However, if you start a lab you must finish it or at least execute the necessary steps at the end of the lab to reset the environment before moving on.

Relevant "Getting Started" steps can be found within each lab.
