# Oracle Audit Vault and Database Firewall 


## Lab 200: REDUCE TIME TO COMPLIANCE USING ORACLE AUDIT VAULT REPORTING

### Overview

- In this lab exercise, you will accomplish the following:
     - Generate a variety of reports available in Audit Vault including:
          - Data Access Report
          - Database Vault Audit Report 
          - System Management 
          - Entitlement Snapshot
          - Compliance Reports
    
- Once you determine what you need to audit, you will have a better understanding of which reports are needed to demonstrate compliance to the various requirements.  In this exercise, you will see how to generate useful reports to these Database Audit Requirements.dfs

### Data Access Reports

- Click the **Reports** tab and select the **Data Access** report within the **Activity Reports** section (expand that section).  View the report by clicking on the **Data Access** link and verify that you see audit records that were collected on today’s date. (Uncheck **Event Time is in the Last 24 hours** to see further back)

- Review the **Data Access Report**.  The Data Access Report displays audited data manipulation language (DML) activities (i.e. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DROP SQL) statements.

- Return to the **Reports** page by clicking on the breadcrumb above the report

  ![](images/avdflab200img007.png)

- Click the **Database Schema Changes** report.  All DML activity is captured here.  Here are some sample audit policies that will generate records here.
     - AUDIT  DELETE;
	- AUDIT  INSERT;
	- AUDIT  SELECT;
	- AUDIT  TRUNCATE TABLE;
	- AUDIT  UPDATE;
	- CREATE USER;

### Secured target startup and shutdown report

- Return to the **Activity Reports** page under the **Reports** tab.  Select **Startup and Shutdown** report.  It lists STARTUP and SHUTDOWN operations on a database.  Drill into one of these records:

### Entitlement snapshots & reports

- Go back to the **Reports** tab and select **Entitlement Changes**.  This report shows all User Entitlement activity for a specific period of time:

  ![](images/avdflab200img012.png)

- However, it will generally be more useful to report on what has CHANGED over a specific period of time.  Navigate to the **Activity Reports** page and then open the **Entitlement Reports** section:

  ![](images/avdflab200img013.png)

- Click the **User Accounts** report. The **User Accounts** Report displays the latest snapshot of Database users with their account profile and values for sources registered with Oracle Audit Vault.

  ![](images/avdflab200img014.png)

- Initially you will not see any reporting data.  Click **Go** (next to the **Label** drop down).  This will bring back the latest Entitlement snapshot that you just retrieved from the source database.  You can take multiple snapshots of user entitlement data, this report lets you look at the data for any of these snapshots.  You can also compare different snapshots to see how the data has changed over time.

### Compliance Reports

- Click the **Compliance Reports** tab.  The reports shown here are intended to help you meet your compliance reporting requirements as quickly as possible, across PCI, Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA (healthcare-related) and other areas. We will look at the **Payment Card Industry (PCI) Reports**. To select the databases you are interested in generating reports for press **Go**

- Click **Done** once you have finished.

## Additional Steps

- Quickly review other reports and the audit data they collect. Take a look at some of the reports.  It is important to point out that these reports will eventually (after the next set of lab exercises) include data collected from all sources, including Database Auditing and Firewall.

 ### Conclusion

- Generated a variety of reports available in the Audit Vault Server.
     - Data Access Reports
     - System Startup and Shutdown
     - Entitlement Reports
